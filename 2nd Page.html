        <!--Beginning of the 2nd page, the 3rd game we'll be talking about, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate-->
        Super Smash Bros. Ultimate had a unique development cycle to say the
        least, it was a surprise to everyone, even the creator of the game, yes,
        you read that correctly. If you don't know, Masahiro Sakurai was able to
        make Super Smash Bros, the first game of the series by getting funding
        from Nintendo, one of the main reasons being that that was before
        concepts like self publishing had been popularized and while that was a
        good idea then, it was the same reason that a 5th installment of Super
        Smash Bros was being made as Nintendo was not about to let go of one of
        their most <del>profitable</del> Iconic Franchises, so they decided to
        start a new game and since they owned the I.P, even if Masahiro Sakurai
        didn't want to, if he wanted to keep the reputation of one of his most
        successful franchises, just like Sisyphus and others that came before
        him, he would have to push the boulder another time.
        <b style="font-size: 25px">But</b> that wasn't all as that boulder had
        extra weights this time, as Masahiro Sakurai included
        <i>every single character that had ever been in a Smash Bros game</i>
        and <i>more</i>, all in 2.5 years, for reference, Pokemon, a franchise
        that has been criticized time and time again for having short dev times
        that leads to releasing games in such a low quality, they must have
        <b style="font-size: 30px"><i>escaped</i></b
        >, takes at least 3 years to make a mainline game, not to mention, Smash
        Bros isn't as popular as Pokemon, it <b>needs</b> to be polished to fly
        off shelves and, yet, with all those factors against, Masahiro Sakurai
        and his team, said "Nah, I'd win" (Surprising if you get that reference)
        and released one of the most successful games on the switch, a console
        that has over 150 million units, over 20% of those consoles have Super
        Smash Bros Ultimate, in other words, the game sold... over 36 million
        copies. One of the greatest feats in game dev of all time.

        <!--The 4th and final game we'll be talking about, Hollow Knight Silksong-->
        Hollow Knight: Silksong, a game that was so long in development, that
        most people couldn't tell whether the fans became deranged from the wait
        or if they were always like that, a game in development for so long, is
        was proclaimed as the GTA 6 of indie games, a game with so much hype
        behind it, that game devs changed their release date because they didn't
        want to be crushed by the Silksong Avalanche, a game so popular, that it
        crashed the servers of the 3, most popular platforms, Playstation, Xbox
        and Nintendo. I'm sure you're tired of the intro by now, so let's get to
        the point, Hollow Knight: Silksong was originally planned to be a DLC,
        but the devs just continued adding things to it, increasing the scope,
        delaying, rinse and repeat, until they decided to make it a full game.
        Since they were so "locked in", the only "acceptable" excuse I can give
        for their lack of information, we don't really know much about the
        development, it presumably went smoothly, since as an indie dev, they
        had no producer to pressure them and the fans weren't asking them for
        news, just going wild in their circles. They were able to focus on
        making the game, so, as far as Hollow Knight was concerned, for the most
        part, peace and harmony was achieved, at least, up until the...
        announcement. Team Cherry decided to drop a bomb, on the level of
        destruction of missiles, they randomly tweeted the release date,
        September 4th, 2025, a date was set in stone, as it got closer, the
        tensions grew higher, like a volcano about to erupt, and then... the day
        came, the game was released, for $20, I might add and sealed itself as
        one of the greatest games of all time.
