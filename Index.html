        like RPGs specifically? The genre where you usually overcome an
        incredibly difficult challenge and come out stronger in the end. If you
        haven't played one, you're most likely missing out but at the same time,
        there are other ways to experience difficult challenges and come out on
        top, sports like Soccer and Basketball, artistic activities like "Art"
        and Music <i>or</i> creating virtual realities accessed by a wide range
        of mysterious devices so other people can have fun accessing those weird
        realities, which gets more interesting when you realize that the vast
        majority of those who use these strange devices have absolutely no idea
        how they work, the name the public has given to them are called

        The Legend of Zelda, the 1st game we'll be talking about-->
        The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a 2017 action-adventure game
        developed by Nintendo for the Wii U and Nintendo Switch. It s set
        presumably set near the end of the Zelda timeline, now let's talk about
        it's development. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was in
        development for around 5 years, with development in 2012 and ending in
        2017, it was planned to be a launch title for the Wii U, but due to the
        game's scope and ambition, it was delayed multiple times. The game was
        eventually released as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch, missing
        the deadline by a long margin in March 2017, alongside the Wii U
        version. The game received near instant critical acclaim upon release,
        with many praising its design, attention to detail, and successful
        innovative gameplay mechanics. It won multiple awards, including Game of
        the Year awards from various gaming publications and award shows. The
        game has sold over 30 <b>million</b> copies worldwide across both
        platforms, making it one of the best-selling games of all time.

      Final Fantasy, a fantastic game and the 2nd game we'll be talking about
-->
        Final Fantasy VII is a pretty old game (you can tell from the low
        quality image) but is still respected and talked about, even today, it's
        a 1997 role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now
        Square Enix) for the PlayStation. It's the seventh main installment in
        the Final Fantasy series and was directed by Yoshinori Kitase and
        produced by Hironobu Sakaguchi. Since it's was made in the 90s, they
        were just transitioning from 2D to 3D graphics, so the game features 3D
        character models and pre-rendered backgrounds, not to mention, they
        moved from developing for Nintendo to Sony's PlayStation, which was a
        big deal back then. not to mentioned, even with all that, they hade a
        huge plan for the game which required high bills and long hours put in
        by every developer who contributed to the project and finally, the game
        was planned to be released internationally, so it still had to be
        translated and this was before Google Translate. Although, evene with
        all these factors stacked against them, they still managed to create an
        excellent game with a striving community and continue their series.
